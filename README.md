# AI-Powered Development Agent

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered development agent that assists in software development workflows by:
- Tracking the code development process.
- Automatically committing changes at appropriate stages.
- Handling versioning as necessary.
- Maintaining project documentation.

## Features
- **Automated Git Commit & Versioning**: The agent observes code changes and commits them when necessary using predefined standards.
- **Intelligent Documentation Management**: Updates and maintains a structured documentation system.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with GitHub repositories effortlessly.
- **Configurable Workflow**: Allows users to define custom commit policies.
- **Support for Multiple Programming Languages**: Can track and manage repositories in various languages.

## Commit Message Standard
This project follows the **Conventional Commits** standard to ensure clarity and consistency in commit messages. The AI agent automatically generates commit messages using this standard. The format is as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

- `type`: The type of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`).
- `scope`: The affected module or component.
- `description`: A concise description of the change.

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add new authentication system
fix(ui): resolve layout issue in the navbar
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Versioning Standard
This project follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**, and the AI agent automatically determines version updates based on the nature of the changes.

```
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes.
- **MINOR**: New features (backward-compatible).
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and minor improvements.

**Examples:**
```
1.0.0  # Initial stable release
1.1.0  # New feature added
1.1.1  # Minor bug fix
2.0.0  # Major change, breaking backward compatibility
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the agent:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- The agent continuously monitors code changes.
- It automatically commits changes based on a configurable policy using Conventional Commits.
- Maintains project documentation and version logs.
- Automatically updates the project version using Semantic Versioning principles.
